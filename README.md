   As a user, I want to be presented with a choice of three different images of randomly selected products out of a pool of 14 images.
•    As a user, after I select an image, I would like my selection to recorded.
•    As a user, I would like my total clicks to be recorded.
•    As a user, after I make a selection from the three images, I would like to be presented a new selection of three images.
•    As a user, I would to be prompted to view my results after 15 sets of images are presented.
•    As a user, I would like to be prompted to reset the entire exercise after viewing the results.
•    As a user, I would like to be called an idiot if I miss the image when clicking.
•    As a user, I would like a horribly, poorly spelled instructional header.
•    As a user, I would like a shadow box effect on each image.
•    As a user, I would like the images to be centered inside the bounding box.
•    As a user, I would like all bounding boxes to be the same size, horizontally aligned, and equidistance apart.
